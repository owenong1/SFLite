Do note:
- The App comes preloaded with mock data that it defaults to if search is unavailable, or if a blank string is searched.
- A non-local website version is available at https://sf-app-khaki.vercel.app. However, do note that it does not support live search at the moment.

## Brief Design Philosophy
The vision for this app is as a no-frills minimalist alternative to the SkillsFuture course portal, hence the name SkillsFuture Lite. The guiding principle is to support users in quickly identifying whether a course aligns with their goals, interests, and constraints. As such, the card design should surface the most critical information at a glance, in order of importance. This reduces cognitive load by allowing users to rule out courses as fast as possible, enabling more efficient decision making.

The following user Decision-Making Framework was utilized to frame the importance hierarchy (relevant components for each point are in brackets):
Assumption: When evaluating courses, users typically ask themselves three core questions:
1. Do I want/need to take this course?
- Does it provide the skills I need? (Course Title, Skills/Outcomes)
- Does it capture my interest? (Course Title, Description)
- Is it credible and worth my time? (Provider, Ratings/Reviews)
2. Is this course feasible for me?
- Does it fit into my schedule? (Duration, Timing, Mode: part-time/full-time)
- Is it financially viable? (Cost, Subsidies ‚Äî presented as a secondary consideration due to the nature of SkillsFuture)
3. How can I take action?
- How do I register immediately? (Clear CTA: ‚ÄúVisit Website‚Äù)
- How can I save it for later? (Bookmark)

Lacking real user data, some assumptions had to be made, but it is assumed that the above framework provides a reasonable approximation sufficient for the scope of the app.

Visuals-wise, I debated whether using emojis would fit the minimalist aesthetic or not, but decided to go with them as it seemed easier to visually parse the information, and they provided a small touch of visual interest lacking which the site might appear too plain. The decision to implement the bookmark feature also arose because I wanted there to be something breaking the monotony of the act of browsing. Through experimentation, I found that using a light happy red and a filled up heart emoji for a successful bookmark in contrast with the starker white background provided a light sense of satisfaction, akin to a tiny minigame.
